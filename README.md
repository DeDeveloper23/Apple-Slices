## Project Status

Apple-Slices is currently in its early stages of development. Interestingly, the initial codebase was entirely generated by Cursor Composer, an AI-powered development tool. The project was initiated by a non-Apple developer, showcasing the potential of AI in software development.

However, as the project grows, we acknowledge that the code will need refinement and optimization. We welcome contributions from experienced developers to help improve the codebase, add new features, and ensure best practices are followed.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from developers of all skill levels. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, your input is valuable. Please check our contribution guidelines (coming soon) for more information on how to get started.
